        "text": "THE PROVINCE, Saturday, Jan. 18, 1958 [[28?]]123\nB.C. Magazine\n[[picture]]\nILLUSTRATED BY BERT SANDERSON\nBill Miner -- last of the train robbers\nThe story of a lovable scoundrel\nby P. W. Luce\nWell-known Vancouver writer and humorist\n\nI have been a newspaper man for 50 years and have handled my share of big stories. The biggest of all was the escape of Bill Miner from the New Westminster Penitentiary. It made the front page all over the continent, and the background is full of loose ends, strange rumors, and the stubborn silence of high authority.\nBill Miner was the last of the notorious train robbers. He was a lovable scoundrel who posed as a grown-up Boy Scout. He never killed a man, and never fired a shot except in self-defence.\nHe claimed that he robbed the rich to help the poor, and thought of himself as the Robin Hood of the nineteenth century.\nMiner stopped his first stagecoach in Texas before he was 17. For the next few years he was a horse thief and cattle rustler in the southern states, with an occasional stage hold-up by way of variety. He was often caught and convicted, but usually escaped from jail. \nWorking his way west, Miner got into San Quentin penitentiary for five years for a stage robbery that yielded him only a few dollars. When released he joined forces with Billy Leroy, a notorious Rocky Mountain highwayman. They took $3,600 from the Del Norte stage, but Leroy was caught and hanged. Miner got away with the loot.\nA train hold-up in Michigan yielded $35,000 but all this went to his elusive partner. Miner was caught and sent to San Quentin for 25 years.\n\n$10,000 price for his capture\n\nBill Miner was nearly 60 when his sentence expired. Three months later he started a life sentence in the Oregon penitentiary for a train hold-up, but he escaped within two years, pulled off a few small jobs, made a big haul on an Oregon train, and then holed up at Haney, 26 miles east of Vancouver, with a price of $10,000 on his head. He busied himself mending the shoes of poor children, but wouldn't do any cobbling for those able to pay.\nAlthough apparently an exemplary character, Miner hadn't reformed. With two companions, he held up the CPR train west of Mission on September 10, 1904, and grabbed a package of Cariboo gold dust worth $7,000 from the express car. They had expected to get their hands on a $63,000 gold shipment form the Cariboo Consolidated, but this had been delayed.\nThe bandits took all the registered mail. Rumor had it that there was $100,000 worth of unregistered bonds in this, and that these bonds played a big part in engineering Bill Miner's escape from the penitentiary a few years  later. \nAlthough rewards totaling $12,500 were offered, no arrests were made. After a short stay in the States, Miner returned to his cabin near Haney and once more cobbled shoes for poor little boys and girls, and was generous in his support of good causes. \n\nTrain robbery was disastrous\n\nIn the fall of 1905, Miner and four others rustled 50 head of horses near Spokane, and sold them in Canada.\nHe lived the life of Riley in the little town of Hedley for a few months while planning a train holdup which was expected to enrich his gang by $35,000, but which turned out to be disastrous.\nAt midnight on May 8, 1905, Miner, Shorty Dunn and Lewis Colquhoun levelled guns at the engineer of CPR No. 97 at Ducks, and ordered him to stop at the 116 mile-post.\nThere the mail car was cut off from the rest of the train, the doors forced open, and the registered mail pawed over by the bandits. They could find only $100.\n\"Where's the shipment from the Nickle Plate mine?\" demanded Miner.\n\"It's in the express car,\" grinned mail clerk McQuarrie.\nThe $35,000 the bandits were after was in a car which had been left behind when the train was cut. They decided it was too risky to go back for the loot. Months of planning and expenses running into thousands of dollars, had yielded $100 to be divided among six men, the three train robbers, two rustlers in charge of horses for the get-away and the tip-off confederate at the Nickle Plate mine.\n\"Oh well,\" said Miner, philosophically, \"you can't always have the luck.\"\n\nAccomplice got $10 as his share\n\nHe was right. The accomplice who had been waiting at Campbell Creek with three horses allowed two of these to stray on the night of the holdup. He got a blistering tongue lashing for his carelessness, and $10 as his share of the spoils. \nRewards totaling $11,500 were offered. Cowboys, Indian trackers, detectives, policemen and a detachment of Mounties from Calgary scoured the country, and the bandits were ambushed near Douglas Lake, 50 miles south of Ducks, four days after the holdup.\nAt Kamloops, in spite of positive identification, the jury disagreed. Found guilty at a second trial, Miner and Dunn were sentenced to life imprisonment, Colquhoun, a first offender, got 25 years and was released on ticket-of-leave long before his term was up.\n[[picture]]\n\"BILL\" MINER\n. . . last of a breed\n[[picture]]\n\"SHORTY\" DUNN\n. . . he got life\n[[picture]]\nLEWIS COLQUHOUN\n. . . the first-time offender\n\nHis escape was long thought out\n\nBill Miner was an exemplary prisoner and a cunning imposter. He became deeply religious and had books on theology sent to him by outside friends. It is said some of these books were especially prepared, with bills of large denomination in the bindings, and that these were distributed by Bill where they would do him the most good. Money is said to have also come to him in cakes and other delicacies. \nAfter being in the penitentiary for about a year, Miner developed a scalp rash which spread to his face. The doctor did not suspect that the wily bandit was aggravating this by rubbing dirt into his skin, and allowed him to let his hair go uncropped and his mustache to grow, details which proved mighty useful when Miner made his getaway, but of which the public knew nothing till long after.\n\nMorale was low on prison staff\n\nAt that period the New Westminster Penitentiary was understaffed. The guards were dissatisfied with their low pay. The warden, Col. Whyte, was dying. His deputy, D. D. Bourke, was in bed with influenza. Discipline was at deplorably low ebb.\nOn the afternoon of Aug. 8, 1907, Bill Miner was one of a gang of 21 in the brickyards.\nOne of the convicts engaged the attention of the guard for five minutes, and Miner scuttled to a 12-foot fence, one of two that surrounded the penitentiary. A deep hole had been dug under the inner fence and covered by a pile of rubbish, obviously by some inside confederate.\nMiner slipped through the hole and ran to the gate of the outer fence, where the lock had been broken. Once past this, he was in open country.\nIt had been Miner's intention to make a lone get-away, but three other convicts saw him disappear down the hole and followed him. They were A. F. McCluskey and W. J. Woods, who were never caught, and J. W. Clark, an ex-Nanaimo policeman serving a five-year term for theft, who was arrested in Washington a few years later and brought back to finish his sentence. According to him, the four men separated shortly after escaping.\n[[picture]]\nW. P. LUCE\n. . . he was there\n\nFirst reported to be admitted\n\nThere is some question as to what time the convicts got away, but the New Westminster city police got to know about it about 3 o'clock, and everybody else knew of it inside half an hour. \nI was the first reporter to be admitted inside the penitentiary grounds, largely through the good offices of the New Westminster chief of police, to whose sides I clung like a leech while we looked over the scene of the escape. The more we saw the more dubious were were was to what really happened.\nThere was a sad lack of discipline and authority, and no official statement was forthcoming for quite a while. It was plain that the escape of Bill Miner had not surprised the staff half as much as it had amazed the public.\nBecause the convicts had first to be safely locked up and routine precautions taken, a considerable time elapsed before any attempt was made to chase after the fugitives.\nBy the time the search was launched, all traces had disappeared.\n\nStayed in Haney for two days\n\nLong afterwards, Bill Miner said he had made his way alone to his old cabin near Haney, stayed there two days, and then headed for the American border. He had breakfast at the home of George des Roches on Nicomen Island two days after he escaped, and that was the last heard of him for some years.\nWhen he was over 70 he held up a train in Georgia, single handed, and in the depth of winter. He got very little booty, and was caught when asleep in a box car, cold, hungry and worn out.\nWhen given a life sentence the picturesque old bandit asked if he couldn't be sent to British Columbia, to finish his term there.\n\"I never was so well treated in my life, and I've been in a lot of prisons,\" he told the judge.\nThree years later, in 1912, Bill Miner died in the penitentiary hospital. Nobody knows how many thousands he had stolen or how many hold-ups he had staged, but more than half of his long life was spent in jail. He craved excitement and he certainly got lots of it.\nThe official investigation into the Bill Miner escape from the penitentiary was a very hush-hush affair, and did nothing to quiet rumors that influential persons had a hand in it. No reward was offered for his recapture, though a year earlier there had been a price of $11,500 on his head.\nAnyway, it was a whale of a story.",

Discipline was at deplorably low ebb.\nOn the afternoon of Aug. 8, 1907, Bill Miner was one of a gang of 21 in the brickyards.\nOne of the convicts engaged the attention of the guard for five minutes, and Miner scuttled to a 12-foot fence, one of two that surrounded the penitentiary. A deep hole had been dug under the inner fence and covered by a pile of rubbish, obviously by some inside confederate.\nMiner slipped through the hole and ran to the gate of the outer fence, where the lock had been broken. Once past this, he was in open country.\nIt had been Miner's intention to make a lone get-away, but three other convicts saw him disappear down the hole and followed him. They were A. F. McCluskey and W. J. Woods, who were never caught, and J. W. Clark, an ex-Nanaimo policeman serving a five-year term for theft, who was arrested in Washington a few years later and brought back to finish his sentence. According to him, the four men separated shortly after escaping.\n[[picture]]\nW. P. LUCE\n. . . he was there\n\nFirst reported to be admitted\n\nThere is some question as to what time the convicts got away, but the New Westminster city police got to know about it about 3 o'clock, and everybody else knew of it inside half an hour. \nI was the first reporter to be admitted inside the penitentiary grounds, largely through the good offices of the New Westminster chief of police, to whose sides I clung like a leech while we looked over the scene of the escape. The more we saw the more dubious were were was to what really happened.\nThere was a sad lack of discipline and authority, and no official statement was forthcoming for quite a while. It was plain that the escape of Bill Miner had not surprised the staff half as much as it had amazed the public.\nBecause the convicts had first to be safely locked up and routine precautions taken, a considerable time elapsed before any attempt was made to chase after the fugitives.\nBy the time the search was launched, all traces had disappeared.\n\nStayed in Haney for two days\n\nLong afterwards, Bill Miner said he had made his way alone to his old cabin near Haney, stayed there two days, and then headed for the American border. He had breakfast at the home of George des Roches on Nicomen Island two days after he escaped, and that was the last heard of him for some years.\nWhen he was over 70 he held up a train in Georgia, single handed, and in the depth of winter. He got very little booty, and was caught when asleep in a box car, cold, hungry and worn out.\nWhen given a life sentence the picturesque old bandit asked if he couldn't be sent to British Columbia, to finish his term there.\n\"I never was so well treated in my life, and I've been in a lot of prisons,\" he told the judge.\nThree years later, in 1912, Bill Miner died in the penitentiary hospital. Nobody knows how many thousands he had stolen or how many hold-ups he had staged, but more than half of his long life was spent in jail. He craved excitement and he certainly got lots of it.\nThe official investigation into the Bill Miner escape from the penitentiary was a very hush-hush affair, and did nothing to quiet rumors that influential persons had a hand in it. No reward was offered for his recapture, though a year earlier there had been a price of $11,500 on his head.\nAnyway, it was a whale of a story.",
